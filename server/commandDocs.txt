postgresql vs mysql

MySQL doesn't have transactions. MySQL isn't object-relational like
> Postgres. Postgres is more extensible. Postgres has more powerful
> querying facilities. MySQL can be faster for simple stuff.

Postgres Pros:
* Transactions
* Foreign keys ( via refint )
* Triggers
* Subselects
* Views ( mostly )
* User-defined datatypes
* User-defined functions in a variety of languages: sql, c, pl/pgsql, pl/tcl
* Sequences
* Proper date handling

Postgres Cons:
* Somewhat slow for inserts and updates when compared to mysql ( due to
  pgsql having to check for triggers and such )
* Some SELECT queries may be slower than their counterparts in MySQL.

MySQL Pros:
* Extremely fast

MySQL Cons:
* See all of Postgres's Pros, s/^/Lack of /g
* Improper date handling; one can insert '1999-02-32' into a DATE field.

PostgreSQL version: 9.1 (happens to be on my laptop already)
