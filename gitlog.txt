    fmstations database created. perl script renamed to syncDb.pl --> it will not just update existing stations within the database, but will also remove rows for any stations that are not in the new FCC national dataset. syncDb.pl effectively parses the FCC data and updates the fmstations database accordingly, weeding out any stations in the dataset with non-US country codes or missing ERP/HAAT ratings. At this time, an algorithm has been written and tested to identify expired stations. The next update will feature the dynamic removal of those stations as well, all from within this syncDb.pl script
